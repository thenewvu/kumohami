## What is this ?

Well .. I was going to explain it, but it was too verbose, so here you go, see it in real life:

![Demo](/demo.gif?raw=true)

## Installation

1. Clone or download (then decompress) this repo
2. Open Chrome/Settings/Extensions, turn on `Developer mode`, press `Load unpacked extension...` and pick the directory where the repo was cloned (decompressed) to.
3. Open a new tab, press "Apps" on the bookmark bar and finally open `Kumohami`.

## Usage

* Press `Ctrl` key to toggle the toolbar, on the toolbar, you can type the url and press enter to access it, also, there's a draggable area on the right, you can reposition the app by dragging it.
* On Linux, the draggable area might not work with your window manager, bspwm in my case, use the way that the window manager provides to you.
